## Introduction

Accurately predicting stock prices is a challenging yet crucial task for investors and traders. This project harnesses the power of LSTM networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) particularly well-suited for sequence prediction problems, to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The app is built using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use interface for users.
